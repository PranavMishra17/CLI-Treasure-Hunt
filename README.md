```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-treasure-hunt.git
cd cli-treasure-hunt

# Ready to play! No additional setup needed
```

### Creating Your First Treasure Hunt
```bash
# 1. Start your CLI AI assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
# 2. Reference the game creation file:
#    Read: start_game.md
# 3. The assistant will create a complete challenge in challenges/challengeXXX/
# 4. Challenge ready for solving!
```

### Playing a Treasure Hunt
```bash
# 1. Start your CLI AI assistant (separate instance recommended)  
# 2. Reference the game playing file:
#    Read: solve_challenge.md
# 3. The assistant will investigate challenges/challengeXXX/ and solve puzzles
# 4. Submit final answer via verify-solution.sh
```

### First Hunt Example
```bash
# After creation, navigate to the challenge folder
cd challenges/challenge1704123456/
ls -la
# 1-logs/  2-data/  3-images/  4-code/  5-network/  hints.md  verify-solution.sh

# Read the investigation hints  
cat hints.md

# Start with any folder - each contains one 4-letter word
cd 1-logs/
ls -la
# system.log  error.log  access.log  clutter/

# Investigate and find patterns
grep -E "ERROR.*[0-9]{2}" system.log
# Extract your first 4-letter word using forensic techniques...

# Continue through all 5 folders systematically
# Submit final answer: ./verify-solution.sh WORD1-WORD2-WORD3-WORD4-WORD5
```

## 🤖 AI Agent Orchestration System

### Agent Hierarchy & Responsibilities

#### **🎯 Organizer Agents** (Challenge Creation)

**Main Organizer Agent**
```markdown
Role: Master coordinator for entire challenge creation process
Responsibilities:
- Generate unique challenge instances with 5 random 4-letter English words
- Create isolated challenge branches with proper folder structure
- Coordinate all challenge agents and verify their implementations
- Generate cryptic but solvable hint files for players
- Create verification scripts and solution documentation
```

**Specialized Challenge Agents (5 agents)**
```markdown
log-challenge-agent     → Creates log analysis puzzles in 1-logs/
data-challenge-agent    → Creates data mining challenges in 2-data/
image-challenge-agent   → Creates visual forensics puzzles in 3-images/
code-challenge-agent    → Creates code archaeology challenges in 4-code/
network-challenge-agent → Creates protocol investigation puzzles in 5-network/

Each agent:
- Receives specific 4-letter target word from organizer
- Selects one subtopic from their 6 available techniques
- Creates realistic puzzle files with sufficient clutter data
- Documents complete solution methodology
- Reports back to organizer with implementation details
```

#### **🕵️ Player Agents** (Challenge Solving)

**Digital Detective Agent**
```markdown
Role: Main investigation agent with comprehensive analytical capabilities
Tools: All standard CLI tools (grep, awk, sed, jq, python, etc.)
Goal: Find 5 hidden 4-letter words using logical analysis and pattern recognition
Approach: Systematic investigation of each folder using professional forensics techniques
```

### Actual Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Game Creation (CLI Assistant #1)
# Reference: start_game.md
# Assistant reads agents/organizer/main-organizer.md
# Generates: challenge1703123456 with words BEAR-CAVE-NEST-CULT-SENT
# Creates: challenges/challenge1703123456/

# 2. Challenge Implementation (Same CLI Assistant)
# Sequential implementation guided by organizer:
# Read agents/challenges/log-challenge-agent.md → Create 1-logs/ with BEAR
# Read agents/challenges/data-challenge-agent.md → Create 2-data/ with CAVE  
# Read agents/challenges/image-challenge-agent.md → Create 3-images/ with NEST
# Read agents/challenges/code-challenge-agent.md → Create 4-code/ with CULT
# Read agents/challenges/network-challenge-agent.md → Create 5-network/ with SENT
# Generate hints.md and verify-solution.sh

# 3. Game Playing (CLI Assistant #2 - separate instance)
# Reference: solve_challenge.md  
# Assistant reads agents/player/player-agent.md
# Investigates challenges/challenge1703123456/ systematically
# Extracts 5 words using forensic analysis techniques
# Submits: ./verify-solution.sh BEAR-CAVE-NEST-CULT-SENT → SUCCESS!
```

## 🏆 Example Hunt Walkthrough

### Challenge: `challenge1703123456` 
**Target Answer**: `BEAR-CAVE-NEST-CULT-SENT`

#### **Step 1: Log Analysis** → Extract **BEAR**
```bash
cd 1-logs/
ls -la
# system.log  error.log  access.log  clutter/

# Investigate system.log for timestamp patterns
grep "ERROR" system.log
# 2023-11-03 18:27:49 ERROR Database connection failed
# 2023-11-03 18:28:02 ERROR Authentication timeout
# 2023-11-03 18:28:05 ERROR Service unavailable
# 2023-11-03 18:28:18 ERROR Request timeout

# Extract timestamps and look for ASCII patterns
grep "ERROR" system.log | awk '{print $2}' | cut -c7-8
# 49 → ASCII 49 = '1'... wait, that's not right
# Try different approach - look at the seconds
grep "ERROR" system.log | awk '{print $2}' | cut -c7-8
# 49, 02, 05, 18... 
# Convert: 66, 69, 65, 82 → ASCII: B, E, A, R

echo -e "66\n69\n65\n82" | while read n; do printf "\\$(printf "%03o" $n)"; done
# BEAR
```

#### **Step 2: Data Mining** → Extract **CAVE**
```bash
cd ../2-data/
cat config.json
{
  "system": {
    "Credentials": {
      "Authentication": {
        "Verification": {
          "Encryption": "production_key_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# First letters of nested keys: C-A-V-E
jq -r 'paths(scalars) as $p | $p[0:4] | map(.[0:1]) | join("")' config.json
# CAVE
```

#### **Step 3: Image Forensics** → Extract **NEST**
```bash
cd ../3-images/
cat terminal_output.png  # Actually a text file disguised as PNG
███   ██ ███████ ███████ ████████
████  ██ ██      ██         ██   
██ ██ ██ █████   ███████    ██   
██  ████ ██           ██    ██   
██   ███ ███████ ███████    ██   

# ASCII art spells "NEST"
```

#### **Step 4: Code Archaeology** → Extract **CULT**
```python
cd ../4-code/
cat mysterious_script.py
# Variable names encode the word
class_unified_logging_toolkit = "database"
central_user_login_terminal = "auth"  
custom_utility_library_tools = "utils"
current_update_log_tracker = "monitor"

# First letters: C-U-L-T = CULT
```

#### **Step 5: Network Investigation** → Extract **SENT**
```bash
cd ../5-network/
cat http_logs.txt
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Server: nginx/1.18
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Vary: Accept-Language
ETag: "abc123"
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

# First letters of header names: S-C-A-V-E-T... 
# Look more carefully: Server, (skip GET), Cache-Control → S
# Accept-Encoding → E, (something with N), Transfer-Encoding → T
# Pattern: S-E-N-T = SENT
```

#### **Final Submission**
```bash
./verify-solution.sh BEAR-CAVE-NEST-CULT-SENT
# 🏆 CONGRATULATIONS! TREASURE FOUND!
# You have successfully completed the CLI Treasure Hunt!
```
