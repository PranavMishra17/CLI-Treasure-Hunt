## üîç Challenge Locations & Cryptic Hints

### üóÇÔ∏è Challenge 1: The System Keeper's Secret
**Location**: `1-logs/` directory  
**Domain**: System Administration & Log Forensics

> *"System administrators speak in codes, and their logs are full of them. The wise investigator knows that the **priority** of a message can be more important than the message itself. Numbers whisper secrets to those who know their language..."*

**Technique Hint**: *Look at the numbers at the beginning of each log entry.*

---

### üìä Challenge 2: The Data Architect's Pattern  
**Location**: `2-data/` directory
**Domain**: Business Intelligence & Data Analysis

> *"In the world of configuration, nothing is a coincidence. The architects of the system often leave notes for themselves, and these notes can spell out their intentions to those who read between the lines. First impressions in comments are rarely coincidental..."*

**Technique Hint**: *Comments speak louder than code.*

---

### üñºÔ∏è Challenge 3: The Visual Forensics Mystery
**Location**: `3-images/` directory  
**Domain**: Digital Evidence & Media Forensics

> *"Not all treasures are visible to the naked eye. The masters of digital evidence know that **binary data tells stories** that images cannot speak aloud. Sometimes the most valuable information hides in the raw data..."*

**Technique Hint**: *Look at the file in its raw, hexadecimal form.*

---

### üíª Challenge 4: The Developer's Hidden Message
**Location**: `4-code/` directory
**Domain**: Software Security & Code Analysis

> *"Programmers are poets who write in logic, and like all poets, they hide meaning in their choices. The **constants they define** are rarely random - they reflect intention, purpose, and sometimes... secrets waiting to be discovered."*

**Technique Hint**: *Numbers can be more than just numbers.*

---

### üåê Challenge 5: The Network Oracle's Communication
**Location**: `5-network/` directory  
**Domain**: Network Security & Protocol Analysis

> *"The network is configured with rules, and those who understand the rules know that **comments carry more than explanations** - they carry intentions. Communication patterns often form readable sequences for those trained in the art of network forensics..."*

**Technique Hint**: *Read the comments in the configuration files.*
